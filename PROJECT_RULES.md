# Project Rules - DeviceCheck

This repository contains `DeviceCheck.ps1`, an interactive, flicker-free PowerShell TUI for checking connected hardware devices and querying local databases and AI APIs (Gemini, OpenRouter) for details.

## 🔵 PowerShell Runspace Guidelines

🔸 **Disable Progress Reporting:**
Always set `$ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'` at the beginning of any background runspace script block.
Background commands like `Invoke-WebRequest` and `Invoke-RestMethod` write progress bars to the host, which will deadlock the console and corrupt the TUI rendering when executed concurrently.

🔸 **Use Basic Parsing:**
Always use the `-UseBasicParsing` parameter for `Invoke-WebRequest` inside background runspaces to avoid launching the Internet Explorer HTML rendering engine (which hangs or fails on systems without configured IE).

🔸 **Safe Runspace Cleanup:**
Always wrap runspace `.Dispose()` and `.Stop()` calls in `try/catch` blocks and explicitly nullify the PowerShell references (e.g., `$ps = $null`).
This prevents parser interruption from skipping the null assignment and creating an infinite loop.

## 🔵 TUI Rendering Guidelines

🔸 **Synchronized Rendering:**
Wrap TUI frame redraws inside Windows Terminal synchronized output sequences (`Begin-SyncRender` and `End-SyncRender`) to prevent frame tearing and flicker.

🔸 **Color Tagging:**
Highlight model name tags dynamically in the tree.
Use `$_C.Info` (Blue) for Gemini models and `$_C.OK` (Green) for Nvidia/OpenRouter models.

## 🔵 API Key Setup

- Google Gemini API key is loaded from `GOOGLE_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variables (both process-level and user-level registry).
- OpenRouter API key is loaded from the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable.
